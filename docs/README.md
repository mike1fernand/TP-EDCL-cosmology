# Documentation index (canonical)

If you read only a few files:

1. `VALIDATION_MATRIX.md` — paper claim → script → artifact (authoritative)
2. `COLAB_GUIDE.md` — cell-ready commands (referee-friendly)
3. `GITHUB_PUBLISH_CHECKLIST.md` — how to publish code + artifacts
4. `DATA_AVAILABILITY.md` — what is in git vs release assets

Background / internal planning:
- `PRD_referee_path_forward.md` (older planning note; not authoritative)
