# Integration notes

1) Copy this overlay into the repo root (merge/overwrite as needed).
2) Update the root README.md to remove any statement that Tier-A1 is "scaffolding only".
3) Ensure the paper uses the correct repo link macro and references the Tier-A late-only validation as "validated", and CMB Δχ²≈-19 as a projection (Discussion).
