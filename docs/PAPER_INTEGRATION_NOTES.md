# Paper integration notes (where to cite simulations)

This repository is intended to be referenced from the paper as the reproducibility package.

Recommended paper additions:
- Add a “Reproducibility / Code Availability” paragraph that points to:
  - the GitHub repository URL,
  - a tagged release (paper version),
  - and (optionally) a Zenodo DOI.

- In the cosmology section (“Resolving the Hubble Tension” or equivalent):
  - explicitly state that the local H0 likelihood is applied to **H0_obs** (not H0_theory),
  - cite the Tier‑A validation runner and the archived chain outputs (Release assets).

- For each simulation-derived figure:
  - add a short caption sentence: “Generated by `<script path>`; see repository `<tag>`.”

The authoritative mapping from claims/figures to scripts/artifacts is maintained in:
- `docs/VALIDATION_MATRIX.md`
- `traceability.md`
